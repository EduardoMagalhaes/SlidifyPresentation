## Gold and Stock Price App

* This Shiny App will estimate the Stock Option price for a given Gold Mining Company.

* There will be two inputs: A date range and a A given Gold Price cost

### How it works?

* The app gathers data from internet sources for historic gold prices and stock closing values;

* For the date range supplyed, it will fitt the Stock prices in function of Gold Prices;

* There will be a chart for the fitting plot;

* Using the given Gold Target Price, the app will use the linear regression and estimate the Stock-Price;

* An Chart with historic Gold and Stock prices are showed for the selected date-range.

## Motion chart example

Here you can see the Stock Closing Price and Volume for three of top world Gold producers:

```{r motionchartcode, echo=FALSE}
# Quandl Library allows you to use online data sets
library(googleVis)
library(Quandl)
Quandl.auth("o_7e9aEakBmkPksQXFZW")  ## MyPersonal Token

## Read historic gold daily prices

Gold <- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD") # Gold Price

## Read historic GOld Corp Stock prices

KGC <- Quandl("GOOG/NYSE_KGC")  # Kinross Gold Corporation
AUY <- Quandl("GOOG/NYSE_AUY")  # Yamana GOld
ABX <- Quandl("GOOG/NYSE_ABX")  # Barick Gold Corp

## Format Tables

KGC$Quote <- "KGC"
KGC$Open <- NULL
KGC$High <- NULL
KGC$Low <- NULL
KGC <- KGC[,c(4,1,2,3)]

AUY$Quote <- "AUY"
AUY$Open <- NULL
AUY$High <- NULL
AUY$Low <- NULL
AUY <- AUY[,c(4,1,2,3)]

ABX$Quote <- "ABX"
ABX$Open <- NULL
ABX$High <- NULL
ABX$Low <- NULL
ABX <- ABX[,c(4,1,2,3)]

## Merge the two datasets and clean unused collumns

Stocks <- merge(KGC, AUY, all=TRUE)
Stocks <- merge(Stocks, ABX, all=TRUE)

Stocks <- Stocks[,c(1,2,4,3)]  # Resort Stocks to easy gvismotion

## Select only one day per month

Stocks <- Stocks[as.numeric(strftime(Stocks$Date, "%m")) %in% 12 ,]
Stocks <- Stocks[as.numeric(strftime(Stocks$Date, "%d")) %in% 1 ,]

## Plot GoogleVis Chart

plot(gvisMotionChart(Stocks, "Quote", "Date", options=list(width=600, height=400)))

```

## Gold Fun Facts

* The last Gold closing price was `r Gold[1,2]` USD/oz on `r Gold[1,1]`.
* Compared to other metals, gold is much softer. One can beat 1 gram of gold to a 1 square meter sheet and light would shine through that sheet.
* Very few chemicals can attack gold, so that’s why it keeps it shine even when buried for 1000’s of years.
* A total of eighty-eight thousand tons of gold have been extracted from earth ever since. This means all the gold that has been dug up so far in history would, if melted, make a cube measuring approximately 25x25x25 meters.
* Gold is very rare compared with diamonds.
* Gold is one of the heaviest metals in the world. For example, it is 19,3 times as heavy as water. One cubic meter weights some 19.300 kilogram.
